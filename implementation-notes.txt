Ideas:
- Test Coverage 100% -> Configure JaCoCo
- Configure findbugs
- Configure checkstyle
- Configure pmd
- Package structure by feature instead of layer/mixed
- Use internationalization / language / bundle files to directly set the right texts in xml.
- Rewrite conversion logic
- Rewrite tests

Known bugs to be addressed:
- Video time is not correct
- UI should run with separate (view)thread
